In the first synopsis form, the <code class="Nm">cp</code> utility copies the
  contents of the <var class="Ar">source_file</var> to the
  <var class="Ar">target_file</var>. In the second synopsis form, the contents
  of each named <var class="Ar">source_file</var> is copied to the destination
  <var class="Ar">target_directory</var>. The names of the files themselves are
  not changed. If <code class="Nm">cp</code> detects an attempt to copy a file
  to itself, the copy will fail.
<p class="Pp">The following options are available:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#a"><code class="Fl" id="a">-a</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Archive mode. Same as <code class="Fl">-RpP</code>.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#f"><code class="Fl" id="f">-f</code></a></dt>
  <dd>For each existing destination pathname, attempt to overwrite it. If
      permissions do not allow copy to succeed, remove it and create a new file,
      without prompting for confirmation. (The <code class="Fl">-i</code> option
      is ignored if the <code class="Fl">-f</code> option is specified.)</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#H"><code class="Fl" id="H">-H</code></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <code class="Fl">-R</code> option is specified, symbolic links on
      the command line are followed. (Symbolic links encountered in the tree
      traversal are not followed.)</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#i"><code class="Fl" id="i">-i</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Causes <code class="Nm">cp</code> to write a prompt to the standard error
      output before copying a file that would overwrite an existing file. If the
      response from the standard input begins with the character
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">y</code>&#x2019;, the file copy is
    attempted.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#L"><code class="Fl" id="L">-L</code></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <code class="Fl">-R</code> option is specified, all symbolic links
      are followed.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#l"><code class="Fl" id="l">-l</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Create hard links to regular files in a hierarchy instead of copying.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#N"><code class="Fl" id="N">-N</code></a></dt>
  <dd>When used with <code class="Fl">-p</code>, don't copy file flags.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#P"><code class="Fl" id="P">-P</code></a></dt>
  <dd>No symbolic links are followed. This is the default.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl" id="p">-p</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Causes <code class="Nm">cp</code> to preserve in the copy as many of the
      modification time, access time, file flags, file mode, user ID, group ID,
      and extended attributes, as allowed by permissions.
    <p class="Pp">If the user ID and group ID cannot be preserved due to
        insufficient permissions, no error message is displayed and the exit
        value is not altered.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the source file has its set user ID bit on and the user ID
        cannot be preserved, the set user ID bit is not preserved in the copy's
        permissions. If the source file has its set group ID bit on and the
        group ID cannot be preserved, the set group ID bit is not preserved in
        the copy's permissions. If the source file has both its set user ID and
        set group ID bits on, and either the user ID or group ID cannot be
        preserved, neither the set user ID or set group ID bits are preserved in
        the copy's permissions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Extended attributes from all accessible namespaces are copied;
        others are ignored. If an error occurs during this copy, a message is
        displayed and <code class="Nm">cp</code> skips the other extended
        attributes for that file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#R"><code class="Fl" id="R">-R</code></a></dt>
  <dd>If <var class="Ar">source_file</var> designates a directory,
      <code class="Nm">cp</code> copies the directory and the entire subtree
      connected at that point. This option also causes symbolic links to be
      copied, rather than followed, and for <code class="Nm">cp</code> to create
      special files rather than copying them as normal files. Created
      directories have the same mode as the corresponding source directory,
      unmodified by the process's umask.
    <p class="Pp">Note that <code class="Nm">cp</code> copies hard linked files
        as separate files. If you need to preserve hard links, consider using a
        utility like <a class="Xr" href="../html1/pax.html">pax(1)</a>
      instead.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#v"><code class="Fl" id="v">-v</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Causes <code class="Nm">cp</code> to be verbose, showing files as they are
      copied.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For each destination file that already exists, its contents are
    overwritten if permissions allow, but its mode, user ID, and group ID are
    unchanged.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the second synopsis form,
    <var class="Ar">target_directory</var> must exist unless there is only one
    named <var class="Ar">source_file</var> which is a directory and the
    <code class="Fl">-R</code> flag is specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the destination file does not exist, the mode of the source
    file is used as modified by the file mode creation mask
    (<code class="Ic">umask</code>, see
    <a class="Xr" href="../html1/csh.html">csh(1)</a>). If the source file has
    its set user ID bit on, that bit is removed unless both the source file and
    the destination file are owned by the same user. If the source file has its
    set group ID bit on, that bit is removed unless both the source file and the
    destination file are in the same group and the user is a member of that
    group. If both the set user ID and set group ID bits are set, all of the
    above conditions must be fulfilled or both bits are removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Appropriate permissions are required for file creation or
    overwriting.</p>
<p class="Pp">Symbolic links are always followed unless the
    <code class="Fl">-R</code> flag is set, in which case symbolic links are not
    followed, by default. The <code class="Fl">-H</code> or
    <code class="Fl">-L</code> flags (in conjunction with the
    <code class="Fl">-R</code> flag), as well as the <code class="Fl">-P</code>
    flag cause symbolic links to be followed as described above. The
    <code class="Fl">-H</code> and <code class="Fl">-L</code> options are
    ignored unless the <code class="Fl">-R</code> option is specified. In
    addition, these options override each other and the command's actions are
    determined by the last one specified. The default is as if the
    <code class="Fl">-P</code> option had been specified.</p>

Historic versions of the <code class="Nm">cp</code> utility had a
  <code class="Fl">-r</code> option. This implementation supports that option,
  however, its use is strongly discouraged, as it does not correctly copy
  special files, symbolic links, or FIFOs.
