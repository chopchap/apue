Lecture 02
==========

Before class:
-------------
I read chapters 03 in Stevens

I write a program fds.c to:
 - print the value of the STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and 
   STDERR_FILENO constants
 - prints the value of the file descriptors referenced via the 
   stdin, stdout, and stderr streams
 - open(2)s a file, then prints the value of the resulting 
   file descriptor
 - fopen(3)s a file, then prints the value of the file descriptor 
   referenced via that stream
   
I write a program argv.c to:
 - to illustrate how different shells expand arguments differently
   
I came across this interesting web page:
https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html

Open questions:
Can you seek backwards on a pipe?
What happens when try to write data beyond the end of a file?
How efficient is our simple-cat.c program from Week 1?
Can we make it read more data faster?


After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- unamed pipes or fifos can not be lseek(2)ed
- when writing data beyond the end of a file, since the 
  _current file size_ info in i-node has changed, kernel 
  will comapre it with _current file offset_, and update it 
  if the latter is larger.
- simple-cat.c program is quite efficient since by default it 
  doesn't use fd flag O_SYNC
- I implemented bbcp command as in HW1
