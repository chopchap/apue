Lecture 01
==========

Before class:
-------------
I carefully read the course website and syllabus.
I read chapters 01 and 02 in Stevens and the additional reading 
of 'Unix history and basic features'

I compared the different implementations of NetBSD, Linux and 
Illumos, they have commons in argc and argv processing, and I 
found that the NetBSD is the easier to understand since it's 
shorter than others.

I wrote a small hello-world program, debugged the
'welcome.c' program, and set up my VM with the
suitable compiler flags and aliases.

I came across this interesting article:
https://some.website.you.found/something-relevant.html

Open questions:
What's the difference between Linux and NetBSD? Aren't
both Unix?

Why are there different sections for the manual pages?
What does the "(1)" in "ls(1)" mean?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- always use the right compiler flags ('-Wall -Wextra -Werror')
- despite being "unix-like", Linux and NetBSD are
  different OS with different philosophies and licenses
- I still need to grok the pipeline example from class
