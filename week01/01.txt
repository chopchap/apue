Lecture 01
==========

Before class:
-------------
I carefully read the course website and syllabus.
I read chapters 01 and 02 in Stevens and the additional reading 
of 'Unix history and basic features'

I compared the different implementations of 'echo' & 'hostname' 
in NetBSD, Linux and Illumos, they have commons in argc and 
argv processing, and I found that the NetBSD version is easier to 
understand since it's shorter than others.

I wrote a small hello-world program, debugged the
'welcome.c' program, and set up my VM with the
suitable compiler flags and aliases.

I came across this interesting article:
https://www.netmeister.org/book/02-unix.pdf

Open questions:
What's the difference between Linux and NetBSD? Aren't
both Unix?

Why are there different sections for the manual pages?
What does the "(1)" in "ls(1)" mean?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- always use the right compiler flags ('-Wall -Wextra -Werror')
- despite being "unix-like", Linux and NetBSD are
  different OS with different philosophies and licenses
- most of the system functions return -1 when an error occurs
- execlp function always wants a null-terminated argument
- all threads within a process share the same address space, 
  file descriptors, stacks and process-related attributes
