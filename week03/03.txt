I read chapters 04 in Stevens and compared the different implementations 
of the stat(1) command between GNU coreutils and NetBSD

I came across this interesting web page:

Important take-away:
- consistency is a good virtue. (e.g. chmod(2) to act on the file and 
  indirect through symlinks, lchmod(2) to act on the symlink itself, 
  fchmod(2) to act on a file descriptor, and fchmodat(2) to handle 
  relative pathnames)
- the specific struct stat of each os varies, but the greatest common 
  divisor is POSIX specification
- permission 'x' of dir to open files in it, 'r' to iterate over dir's 
  entries, 'wx' to create or delete a file of dir.
