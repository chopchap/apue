Lecture 04
==========

Before class:
-------------
I read chapters 04 & 06 in Stevens

I came across this interesting web page:

Open questions:
what's the parent directory of the root of the filesystem, "/"?
what are the inodes of "dot" and "dot dot" there?
what is the maximum pathname? (not filename)
where do UIDs come from?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- the inode number of '..' and '.' is actually the same, this is the 
  only special case for /
- a maximum path of 4096 characters for most Unix version
- UIDs come from /etc/passwd and /etc/master.passwd, they're 
  an identifier designated by OS
- the Unix file system is a tree-like structure, rooted at /; 
  different file systems can be attached at different directories or 
  mount points.
