## Interprocess Communication Intro
- forms:
  - two processes reading from/writing to a file on a shared file system
    - asynchronous
    - bidirectional
    - related / unrelated processes
    - variable data
  - signals
    - asynchronous
    - related / unrelated processes
  - semaphores (primarily used as a locking mechanism)

## System V IPC
- System V IPC mechanisms use specific IPC kernel structures, utilizing an _identifier_ and a _key_ to reference these in-kernel resources, and as a result, they are obviously and necessarily restricted to communications between processes on the _same_ system.
- System V IPC structures are persistent, the structures will remain present even after a process that created or accessed them has terminated.
- semephores:
  - use `semget(2)`, `semctl(2)`, and `semop(2)`.
  - see `semdemo.c`
  - `$ ipcs -s`: cmd displays information about active semaphores.
  - IPC data flow

  - shared memory:

    - fastest form of IPC
    - access to shared region of memory often controlled using semaphores
    - obtain a shared memory identifier by using `shmget(2)`
    - attach shared memory segment to a processes address space by callying `shmat(2)`
    - detail it using `shmdt(2)`
    - catch-all for shared memory operations: `shmctl(2)`
